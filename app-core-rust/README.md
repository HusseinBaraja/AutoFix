# App Core Rust

Rust background engine and shared core logic for AutoFix.

This component owns the installed product's background mode:

- Tray icon lifecycle.
- Global shortcut listener.
- Keyboard/session tracker.
- Trigger manager.
- Context manager.
- Correction engine router.
- Replacement engine.
- App rules and security layer.

Feature code should be organized by product behavior, not technical layer. Keep modules small, private by default, and colocate tests with the behavior they verify.

Do not implement optional helper mode here until it becomes a committed product requirement.
